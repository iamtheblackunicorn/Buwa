# BLACK UNICORN WALLPAPERS :black_heart:

*Sexy and beautiful wallpapers for your Android-powered device!* :black_heart:

## About :books:

I've always wanted to write an app that had sexy and elegant wallpapers, so this is it. In my opinion most other apps have pretty
boring very unsexy wallpapers.

## Features :test_tube:

- sexy and aesthetically-pleasing wallpapers
- super fast performance
- easy to use
- new wallpapers are added every week

## Download :inbox_tray:

- *Dark Angel* (v.1.0.0): [Download](https://github.com/iamtheblackunicorn/Buwa/releases/download/v.1.0.0/Buwa-v1.0.0-DarkAngel-Release.apk) (18.2 MB)

## Building :hammer:

Make sure that you have the following programs installed:

- Flutter SDK
- Dart SDK
- Android Studio
- Android SDK
- Java JDK
- Xcode
- Make
- Git

After you have installed these, run this command to generate a keystore for the app.

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore key.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias key
```

After having done that, move the keystore to `android/app` and fill in the fields for the keystore password in the file `android/app/key.properties`.

Finally, run these commands:

```bash
$ flutter pub get
$ flutter build apk
```

You have now generated a release build of *Black Unicorn Wallpapers*.
