# BLACK UNICORN WALLPAPERS :black_heart:

*Sexy and beautiful wallpapers for your Android-powered device!* :black_heart:

## About :books:

I've always wanted to write an app that had sexy and elegant wallpapers, so this is it. In my opinion most other apps have pretty
boring very unsexy wallpapers.

## Features :test_tube:

- sexy and aesthetically-pleasing wallpapers
- super fast performance
- easy to use
- new wallpapers are added every week
- localized for German, English, and Spanish
- elegant and minimalist design

## Building :hammer:

Make sure that you have the following programmes installed:

- Flutter SDK
- Dart SDK
- Android Studio
- Android SDK
- Java JDK
- Xcode
- Make
- Git

After you have installed these, run this command to generate a keystore for the app.

```bash
$ keytool -genkey -v -keystore key.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias key
```

After having done that, move the Java keystore to `android/app` and fill in the fields for the keystore password in the file `android/app/key.properties`.

Finally, run these commands:

```bash
$ flutter pub get
$ flutter build apk
```

You have now generated a release build of *Black Unicorn Wallpapers*.

## Extending the supported languages :book:

*Black Unicorn Wallpapers* is localized for German, English, and Spanish. To add a language, simply create a file called `app_languagecode.arb` in `lib/l10n` where `languagecode` represents the language code for the language you want to add. If it were Spanish for example, you would create a file called `app_es.arb`.
Copy and paste the contents from one of the other `*.arb` files and edit the strings accordingly.
Finally, add this line in the list `supportedLocales` in the file `lib/main.dart`.

```dart
const Locale('languagecode', ''),
```

`languagecode` represents the language you are translating for.
